The objectives of Hollow Bone Healing Lodge are based in the individual's Spiritual process. These processes, as varied as each one is, can be effectively transcended in a good way through the Trinity of Body, Mind, Spirit Healing. 

In the Body, we offer a personally developed Healing process that embraces Reiki, Indigenous Spirituality, Bio-Dynamic Cranio Sacral Therapy, and herbal essences in the creation of Rain Medicine Therapy as the main focal Healing process. We also offer relaxation massage in the form of Thai Hot Stem Massage. 

In Mind, we strive to offer the simple art of listening to one's concerns with unbiased non-judgemental graciousness. This allows for client-practioner sharing of the Healing process. This may or may not include referrals to teachings and/or practitioners outside of the Healing Lodge. It is the purpose of Hollow Bone Healing Lodge to assist each individual in their Healing process through any and all influences possible. To achieve this in a good way, we seek to compel each individual to the understanding that they are in charge of their own Healing

In Spirit, we approach in reverence and humbleness the Spiritual teachings of several different Indigenous cultures throughout Pachamama. With the blessings of Creator, The Pipe, Plant Spirits, Spiritual Guides, and the individual's submission, we journey within the power of The Smudge, The Drum, the Flute, and the power of The Pipe to begin the transcendental Healing process. In addition to these blessed Medicines we also embrace the power of the Sweat Lodge. Through the Sweat, the individual's Healing progression is magnified and expedited in a Body, Mind, Spirit cleansing and assistance of both Ancestors and possibly others present for the Ceremony. In the "Lodge" we all work together to heal each other.
